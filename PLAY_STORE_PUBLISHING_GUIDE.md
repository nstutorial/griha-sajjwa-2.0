# Money Tracker Pro - Play Store Publishing Guide

## üì± Preparing Your App for Google Play Store

### Prerequisites
1. **Google Play Console Account**: You need a Google Play Console developer account ($25 one-time fee)
2. **Android Studio**: Install Android Studio for building the release APK/AAB
3. **Java Keytool**: For generating keystore files (comes with Android Studio)

## üîê Step 1: App Signing Setup

### Generate Keystore File
```bash
# Navigate to the android/app directory
cd android/app

# Generate keystore (replace passwords with your own)
keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore money-tracker-pro-release-key.jks -keystore-type PKCS12 -alias money-tracker-pro -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

# When prompted, enter:
# - Keystore password: (choose a strong password)
# - Key password: (use same or different password)
# - Your name and organization info
```

### Configure Signing
1. Copy the generated `money-tracker-pro-release-key.jks` file to `android/app/`
2. Add `android/app/signing.gradle` (create this file):

```gradle
android {
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            storeFile file('money-tracker-pro-release-key.jks')
            storePassword project.hasProperty('STOREPASS') ? STOREPASS : ''
            keyAlias project.hasProperty('KEYALIAS') ? KEYALIAS : ''
            keyPassword project.hasProperty('KEYPASS') ? KEYPASS : ''
        }
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
            minifyEnabled true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
}
```

3. Update `android/app/build.gradle` to include: `apply from: 'signing.gradle'`

## üèóÔ∏è Step 2: Build Release Version

### Using our custom script:
```bash
# In project root
npm run android:build
```

### Manual build:
```bash
# Build web assets
npm run build

# Sync with Android
npx cap sync android

# Build release AAB (recommended for Play Store)

```

### Output files:
